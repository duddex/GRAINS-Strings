# GRAINS-Strings
Strings module for AEModular GRAINS. Based on Jan Ostmans Solina code

Based on Jan Ostmans Solina code. The page https://janostman.wordpress.com/ is not available anymore, ut the code can be found here: https://modwiggler.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=146006

I also used code from https://makesynthsnotwar.com/stringtheory-software/

This is still work in progress as I encountered some issued (notes don't stop).
